                Was responsible for some administrative set-up, as well as core ai-design as well as weapon and enemy design while recreating the core game.
                For our additional mechanica, I was responsible for implementing a majority of mechanical interactions with enemies, and some UI.

                The technologies used were C# for scripting and Unity as our game engine. Github was used a version management and Jira for organization.
