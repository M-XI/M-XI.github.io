                <b>Quick Start:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        WASD for movement
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        X for primary weapon, Z for secondary
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Press 1 to toggle invincibility, 4 to toggle stages
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Was responsible for some administrative set-up, as well as core ai design and weapon/enemy design while recreating the core game.
                <br>
                For our additional mechanics, I was responsible for implementing a majority of mechanical interactions with enemies, and some UI.
            </li>
            <li>
                The technologies used were C# for scripting and Unity as our game engine. Github was used a version management and Jira for organization.
            </li>

                Shoutout to my group member for excellent level design and insane bug-finding skills!
