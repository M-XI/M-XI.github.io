                Was responsible for some administrative set-up, as well as core ai design and weapon/enemy design while recreating the core game.
                <br>
                For our additional mechanics, I was responsible for implementing a majority of mechanical interactions with enemies, and some UI.
            </li>
            <li>
                The technologies used were C# for scripting and Unity as our game engine. Github was used a version management and Jira for organization.

                The P2 solo project, resembles a clone of games such as Vampire Survivors or 20 Minutes Till Dawn, but with a time-slow mechanic linked to a power resource.
                We note the resolution may not be optimal, but should be playable on most devices.
